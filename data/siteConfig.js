  authorDescription: `Software developer since 2018, started studying as a self-taught programmer in January 2018 
    and attended a Java course (June 2018 - October 2018) that introduced me to the world of software development.<br/>
    After that I mainly worked as a Frontend developer with full-stack knowledges that allowed me to switch many projects
    and study new technologies. I recently got into mobile development with Flutter by studying it in my spare time and got a job as Mobile Developer.
    I love to travel, work out and study new things.`,
